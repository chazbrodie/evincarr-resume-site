  bio: `I've spent 15+ years making operations run smoother across retail, small business, and nonprofits. Everything changed when I started using AI tools. Now I build automations using Claude AI, Zapier, and Google Apps Script, eliminating manual work and freeing up teams to focus on what matters.

I'm obsessed with Claude AI and use it for everything. Building automations, troubleshooting code, optimizing workflows, and yes, even building this entire website despite having zero web development experience. If there's a repetitive task, I'm already thinking about how to automate it.

I've spent more than 15 years in operations across wildly different environments. Bike shops, big box retail, my own solar consulting business, and nonprofit disaster recovery work. Different industries, same skill set: I spot the inefficiency, figure out how to fix it, and keep things running smoothly. After 20 years in retail and HR, I semi-retired to live full-time in an RV for seven years, during which I learned solar systems, built a consulting business, and wrote extensively about RV technology.`,
