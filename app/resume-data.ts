  bio: `I'm the person in the background making sure things actually work. Currently at Storm King Consulting where I coordinate events and build automations that save our small team time. Recent win: solved a 6-month dashboard challenge in a couple days with Google Workspace scripts and Slack bots, saving leadership 50+ hours annually. Not bad for someone who'd never built automations before - just YouTube, Google, and trial and error.

I geek out on process automation and figuring out how to make tech do the boring stuff so humans can focus on the interesting parts. Heavy Claude user for everything from building this website (yes, I built this with Claude despite being a complete beginner) to workflow optimization and problem-solving. If there's a repetitive task, I'm already thinking about how to automate it.

I've spent 15+ years in operations across wildly different environments - bike shops, big box retail, my own solar consulting business, and nonprofit disaster recovery work with the American Red Cross. Different industries, same skill set: spot the inefficiency, figure out how to fix it, keep things running smoothly. After 20 years in retail and HR, I semi-retired to live full-time in an RV for 7 years. Learned solar. Built a consulting business. Now I'm back doing operations work - the kind that makes leadership's lives easier.`,
