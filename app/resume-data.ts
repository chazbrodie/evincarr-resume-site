  bio: `I'm the person in the background making sure things actually work. I'm currently working at Storm King Consulting, where I coordinate events and build automations that save our small team time. I recently built an automated RSVP tracking dashboard in two days using Google Workspace scripts and Slack bots—consolidating data from multiple event forms into real-time updates.

I'm obsessed with Claude AI and use it for everything—building automations, troubleshooting code, optimizing workflows, and yes, even building this entire website despite having zero web development experience. If there's a repetitive task, I'm already thinking about how to automate it with Claude's help.

I've spent more than 15 years in operations across wildly different environments—bike shops, big box retail, my own solar consulting business, and nonprofit disaster recovery work. Different industries, same skill set: I spot the inefficiency, figure out how to fix it, and keep things running smoothly. After 20 years in retail and HR, I decided to travel full time in an RV, during which I learned solar systems, built a consulting business, and wrote extensively about RV technology.`,
