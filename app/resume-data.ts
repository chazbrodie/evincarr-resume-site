  bio: `I'm the person in the background making sure things actually work. Currently at Storm King Consulting where I coordinate events and build automations that save our small team time. Recent win: solved a 6-month dashboard challenge in a couple days with Google Workspace scripts and Slack bots, saving leadership 50+ hours annually.

I'm obsessed with Claude AI and use it for everything - building automations, troubleshooting code, optimizing workflows, and yes, even building this entire website despite having zero web dev experience. If there's a repetitive task, I'm already thinking about how to automate it with Claude's help.

I've spent 15+ years in operations across wildly different environments - bike shops, big box retail, my own solar consulting business, and nonprofit disaster recovery work. Different industries, same skill set: spot the inefficiency, figure out how to fix it, keep things running smoothly. After 20 years in retail and HR, I semi-retired to live full-time in an RV for 7 years where I learned solar systems, built a consulting business, and wrote extensively about RV technology.`,
