## 4. Social Media Guidelines

### Platforms (Priority Order)
1. **LinkedIn** — Primary. Professional audience matches perfectly.
2. **Twitter/X** — Building in public, tech community, indie hacker audience.
3. **Reddit** — r/resumes, r/jobs, r/careerguidance, r/SaaS, r/indiehackers
4. **TikTok** — Short resume tips, AI demo videos (future)
5. **YouTube** — Tutorials, product demos (future)

### Posting Cadence
- LinkedIn: 3-5x/week
- Twitter/X: Daily
- Reddit: 2-3x/week (value-first, not spammy)

### Content Pillars
1. **Resume tips** — Practical advice anyone can use (builds trust)
2. **Product updates** — New features, improvements (shows momentum)
3. **Building in public** — Behind-the-scenes of building ResumeHowl (builds audience)
4. **User wins** — Success stories, testimonials (social proof)
5. **Industry insights** — Job market trends, hiring tips (establishes authority)

### Social Media Don'ts
- Don't be spammy or overly promotional
- Don't trash competitors by name
- Don't make promises you can't keep ("guaranteed job in 30 days")
- Don't post without proofreading
